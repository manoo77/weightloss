								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you are carrying around a few (I use that term loosely) extra pounds like most of us are, you all know all the reasons why we should take the weight off. It will reduce stress on our heart, reducing the chance of heart disease, cancer, the possibility of diabetes; feel better, look more attractive, etc. </p>



<p>There are 101 reasons why, but it can be a real pain to finally get that weight off. You push really hard, make a little progress, get sidetracked, and bam you are heavier then you started.  </p>



<p>It’s maddening.  Enough with that hassle, I have put together 5 simple steps to actually<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" losing weight (opens in a new tab)"> losing weight</a> and keeping it off. These steps can be applied to anything, but we are focusing on weight loss here. </p>



<ol><li>Know What You Want</li><li>Know Where You Are</li><li>Track Your Results </li><li>Make Course Corrections </li><li>Being held Accountable</li></ol>



<p>Now all your extra weight will effortlessly melt off.  Yeah right! A simple list of 5 items is not going to do it, so let me explain the intricacies of the 5 items and where the hang-up normally occurs when applied to lose weight.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/healthy-eating-9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-348" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/healthy-eating-9.jpg 930w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/healthy-eating-9-300x97.jpg 300w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/healthy-eating-9-768x248.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></a></figure>



<h4>Know What You Want  </h4>



<p>This one is dead simple. Most people that want to<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" lose weight (opens in a new tab)"> lose weight</a> have an idea of how many pounds they would like to lose or how they would like their bodies to look. </p>



<p>I think we can safely say if your body started looking the way you wanted it, you would know, even if you didn’t have it completely mapped out and detailed.</p>



<h4>Know Where You Are </h4>



<p>This is the big trip up. It is almost always overlooked and is the number one reason for the up and down Yo-Yo effect we experience with losing weight. We are unhappy with how our body feels and how it looks and it is painful to zoom in and get an accurate picture of where we are. Unfortunately, we have to know where we are, to be able to accurately judge the results we are getting. </p>



<p>You are on a trip to San Diego, California. You would like to start your trip from Phoenix, Arizona, but you really don’t know where you are. No problem.  You get an Arizona/California map and find that a simple 6 hours trip west on interstate 8 will get you to San Diego. </p>



<p>6 hours later, you have no clue where you are and it is definitely not warm San Diego.  You feel defeated and you want to give up!  Do you blame the car? The stupid maps? San Diego? Yourself?</p>



<p>Now, what if I told you, you were actually in New Your City, not Phoenix, Arizona. A 6-hour car ride west from New York City will never get you to San Diego.</p>



<p>If you took the time to accurately find out where you were, you would have been able to choose the appropriate means to get to San Diego and have an expectation as to how long it would take.</p>



<p>This is the same with <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="weight loss (opens in a new tab)">weight loss</a> and our personal physical condition. In our minds, we think we are starting in a different physical condition then we really are. When the results don’t follow the illusion in your mind, we get upset. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-206" width="294" height="294" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package.jpg 250w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a></figure>



<h4>Track Your Results </h4>



<p>This is conceptually simple. If we have no clue as to WHAT we are doing, how do we know what is working? It might be simple to do but it is also simple not to do. In the end, most people never track their results.</p>



<h4>Make Course Corrections </h4>



<p>We love to do this one. We have it hands down. It is like step 1 of knowing what you want. We try the new food diet, the super sit up machine, and the cardio hip hop power energy yoga<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" fat burner (opens in a new tab)"> fat burner</a> class. </p>



<p>We might be great at switching it up, but without knowing where we are starting from and a history of tracked results, we have no clue as to what we should change or even which direction we should go. </p>



<h4>Being held Accountable</h4>



<p>No, not accountability! That is an evil word. I don’t want someone to know what I am doing, or more importantly what I am not doing. </p>



<p>So, why do we resist accountability, your secret weapon to weight loss?  Because it works!  If you know someone is going to be watching, you would follow through or at least feel very uncomfortable not following through.</p>



<p>Accountability, when used wisely, is the ultimate turbo booster to your weight loss. Since you are going to be accountable anyway, you might as well get something out of it. </p>



<p>Using accountability upfront, you can achieve the body of your dreams. If you let your body hold you accountable, it will throw on fat in places you don’t want it to be.  </p>



<p>The biggest obstacle to weight loss is not taking any action. It doesn’t matter how good the plan is, it is worthless if you don’t follow it. So what do I do now? </p>



<p>First and foremost get Accountable.</p>



<p>Forward this article to someone you respect and care about and tell them I want to be accountable for finally taking off my extra pounds. When they agree to support you, start working through Steps 1 – 5.</p>

<p>Weight loss is one of those subjects that everyone is always talking about. It seems you can’t go anywhere without seeing or hearing some type of weight loss message. Stories of the dangers of not losing weight appear regularly on the nightly news. Retail outlets and the Internet both are full of weight loss books and products. Weight loss is discussed in medical centers and at schools and even in the workplace. If you’re trying to lose weight, here are a few tips to get you going. </p>



<h4>Tip #1 – Stop Talking About Weight Loss!</h4>



<p>All that talk about how much you want to lose weight isn’t going to make the weight come off. You’ve got to take action, starting right now. So take this simple advice: Stop moving your mouth and start moving your body! It won’t take long to begin seeing the results.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jenna-b_a-no-text.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-192" width="334" height="261" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jenna-b_a-no-text.jpg 671w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jenna-b_a-no-text-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" /></a></figure>



<h4>Tip #2 – Slow and Steady is Best</h4>



<p>Slow and steady weight loss is better (and safer) than riding the dieting roller coaster. If you’re looking for long-lasting weight loss results, aim to lose an average of about two pounds each week. In order to lose weight, you’ve got to consume fewer calories than you burn. As a bonus, when you combine dieting with exercise, you’ll be reducing your caloric intake and increasing your caloric burn rate at the same time. </p>



<h4>Tip #3 – Save Your Money</h4>



<p>Don’t spend your hard-earned money on the latest<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" weight loss (opens in a new tab)"> weight loss</a> gimmicks. Pills, fad diets, hypnosis, and extreme surgical procedures are not the answer! These gimmicks won’t slim you down, but they will fatten the bank accounts of those who promote them! Eating a nutritionally-balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, good fats, and lean proteins will encourage weight loss faster than any miracle cure you can buy.</p>



<h4>Tip #4 – Weight Loss is a Way of Life</h4>



<p>Unfortunately, the issue of weight is something that most people will struggle with throughout life. Excess processed foods and a sedentary lifestyle are the two biggest contributors to this constant struggle. If you want to lose weight and keep it off, you’ve got to change the way you think about food. It should be thought of as a source of fuel, not a passion. <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Successful weight loss (opens in a new tab)">Successful weight loss</a> really is about making lifestyle changes, including making the right food choices, and then sticking with those choices throughout life. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package.png" alt="" class="wp-image-191" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package.png 250w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></figure>



<h4>Tip #5 – Weight Loss is More Than a Number</h4>



<p>When you’re dieting, don’t become a victim of the dreaded scale. When the numbers go down, happiness goes up. But when the numbers stay the same or go up, it is easy to give up and give in. Remember that even if your weight isn’t changing as you would like, your body is. You’ll be taking better care of your heart. You’ll be lowering your cholesterol levels. You’ll be sporting a leaner body and your clothes will begin fitting more comfortably. When you learn to find joy in these other benefits, you’ll want to keep on being a loser!</p>

<p>Why is it that merely saying the &#8220;D&#8221; word, you know &#8220;diet&#8221; brings immediate thoughts of failure to the minds of many men and women around the world? Could it be that we have all learned through trial and error that diets simply do not work? I know many of you are sitting back with jaws dropped at the moment. After all, this is an article about dieting, right? It is and it isn&#8217;t. <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dieting (opens in a new tab)">Dieting</a> is the kiss of death for many while a new phase in your life or lifestyle adjustment may be just the thing that will mean success for you and your fitness and health goals.</p>



<p>Eating for some is an addiction. Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t exactly give up eating all together as a smoker can give up cigarettes. I&#8217;m not applying by any means that giving up cigarettes is easy but how much more difficult would it be if you were forced to have three a day? At that point, you may as well enjoy them every time the urge hits right? The same holds true for food. You must eat in order to survive. </p>



<p>You cannot live without eating. This means that if food is a problem in your life, you must find a healthier way of viewing food.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/7-weight-loss.jpg" alt="stay fit" class="wp-image-174" width="352" height="193" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/7-weight-loss.jpg 438w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/7-weight-loss-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></a></figure>



<p>Isn&#8217;t this where diets generally come in handy? The short answer is no. This is where diets often fail. Diets do very little to change how we view food. In fact, most diets only serve to tell us which foods are good, which foods are bad, and which foods (typically most of the foods we enjoy most) are strictly taboo. Diets begin by forcing people to feel deprived or punished. And no one likes to feel either of these things. </p>



<p>Even worse, however, is that we punish ourselves further when we slip along the straight and very narrow pathways upon which our diets place us. This means that we are going to wallow in guilt over every little misstep we make until we give up altogether and decide to overindulge once again and ignore the guilt all together. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package.jpg" alt="Losing weight program" class="wp-image-206" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package.jpg 250w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></figure>



<p>In order to have real success, you must make a <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="lifestyle change (opens in a new tab)">lifestyle change</a>. This is the only way that you will be able to shed those unwanted pounds without experiencing the horrible guilt that so many dieters go through each and every step of the way with their diets. Set goals for yourself. Keep them aggressive but realistic for fitness, dropping pounds, and eating new healthy foods. Even if your goal is as simple as eating  5 vegetable servings a day it is a great place to start. </p>



<p>Change your way of eating. Then change your way of seeing food and you will experience amazing changes in your attitudes toward your health, your body, and even your fitness level. As the first pounds begin to drop you will begin to experience more energy and less pain when exercising. This should help keep you motivated to do even more as time goes by.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-629528124-709x1024.jpg" alt="weight loss struggle" class="wp-image-160" width="227" height="327" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-629528124-709x1024.jpg 709w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-629528124-208x300.jpg 208w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-629528124-768x1108.jpg 768w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-629528124-1064x1536.jpg 1064w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-629528124-1419x2048.jpg 1419w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iStock-629528124.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /></a></figure>



<p>Do not think that long term <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="weight loss (opens in a new tab)">weight loss</a> goals will be as easy to achieve as the first five or ten pounds. Consistency is vitally important when making these lifestyle changes. Take each day as it comes and begin again the very next day. This means that even if you fall completely &#8220;off the wagon&#8221; today, you can start over tomorrow. The trick is in staying the course more days than not and learning moderation and balance when it comes to straying from the straight and narrow. </p>



<p>There are many ways to fail when it comes to dieting and I know people who have failed in almost everyone I can possibly imagine. There is no way to fail, however, when you are making positive changes in your life that are getting positive results. It may take weeks, months, or even years to reach your goal. As long as you are making steady and continuous efforts and progress, you are doing many great things for your health and well being.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The numbers on your scale do not indicate whether you are fit or fat. Far more significant than your total body weight is the composition of your body tissue. If a man’s fatty tissue is bigger than 14% up to 15% of his body mass, or if a woman is more than 20% to 22%, he or she is overweight, or more precisely, overfat.</p>



<p>A small amount of fat is needed for padding the internal organs and as insulation under the skin. Excess fat leads to such diseases as diabetes, gout, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and gallbladder problems.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/25-weight-loss.jpg" alt="weight loss the right way" class="wp-image-183" width="348" height="231" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/25-weight-loss.jpg 400w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/25-weight-loss-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /></a></figure>



<p>There are very few, very fat persons. The reason is that the fittest, not the fattest survive.<br> The problem now is focused on how to resolve the problem. The problem with most people who want to <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="lose weight (opens in a new tab)">lose weight</a> is that they have the propensity to concentrate more on getting those numbers lower than what they are seeing now. </p>



<p> What happens next is that they strive harder to achieve a lower weight, according to the “ever reliable” result of the weighing scale.<br> It would be more important to think of the human body as a heat-exchange engine that works on the basic principles of energy physics. The caloric balance equals the total calorie intake minus the total calorie expenditure.  </p>



<p> Some of the calories people ingest are used for basal metabolism. As people get old, their bodies require fewer calories for this basic upkeep. Some calories are excreted as waste products. Some go into “work metabolism,” the energy expenditure required for any physical activity.  </p>



<p> Hence, if people take in more calories than are used by these functions, there is a definite caloric excess. By the laws of physics, energy is transformed rather than destroyed. In this case, each excess of 3,500 calories is changed into a pound of fat. If people want to reverse this process, they have to burn up 3,500 calories to lose a single pound. </p>



<p> Winning the War Against Fat<br> When you think of fighting fat with exercise, you probably think of hours of hard, sweaty exertion. If this is the case, then, you will not get any farther. This is because people who are so much into losing more by exerting more effort tend to get bored easily. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package-1.png" alt="Losing Weight" class="wp-image-108" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package-1.png 250w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package-1-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>Why? Because experts contend that when people exert more effort than what they are capable of doing creates a tendency to develop weariness and ennui. Hence, they give up, stop doing their routine exercises, and end up sulking in the corner with a bag of chips that seems to have all the bad calories in this world.</p>



<p>Now, you might ask, &#8220;What should be done instead?&#8221; The answer: cross-training.<br> After some intensive studies and experimentations, health experts were able to come up with the concept of incorporating cross-training in order to overcome or break the monotony or dullness in an exercise program.</p>



<p>Cross-training refers to the integration of diverse movements or activities into a person’s conventional exercise routine. The main purpose of incorporating cross training into an exercise program is to avoid overdoing excess muscle damages and to put a stop to an imminent boredom.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weightLoss2-932x1024.jpg" alt="Healthy living" class="wp-image-166" width="242" height="266" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weightLoss2-932x1024.jpg 932w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weightLoss2-273x300.jpg 273w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weightLoss2-768x843.jpg 768w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weightLoss2-1399x1536.jpg 1399w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weightLoss2.jpg 1457w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /></a></figure>



<p>Three of the most commonly used activities whenever a person decides to engage in cross-training are swimming, running, and cycling.<br> In cross-training, distance is one way to extend your activity as your condition improves. For this reason, you need to traverse a measured distance. <br> If possible, swim the course and measure the distance. If you will be using a running track, such courses usually are a quarter-mile per lap for a complete circuit. </p>



<p>Cross-training offers a variety of benefits for fitness and fat loss. It builds up the strength and endurance of the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It has also some tranquilizing effect on the nerves, and it burns up calories as much as it makes your “<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="losing weight (opens in a new tab)">losing weight</a>” more bearable.</p>



<p>Cross-training has three basic components:</p>



<ol><li>Endurance exercises to condition the heart, lungs, and blood vessels and to induce relaxation. These begin with a careful planned walking and jogging regimen, depending on fitness level.</li><li>Exercises to strengthen the muscles, particularly those important to good posture. These include some activities that are selected to encourage some people who are already burnt out with a particular routine.</li><li>Exercises to improve joint mobility and prevent or relieve aches and pains. These consist of a series of static stretching positions that are safe and effective for most of the people who wish to try to lose some fat.<br> Indeed, cross-training is a great way to modify the concept of exercising and<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" losing fat (opens in a new tab)"> losing fat</a> without having to endure monotonous activities. In fact, the idea of exercising is to like what you are doing, hence, if you engage in cross-training, you will be aware of it that you have already achieved your desired weight.<br> Boiled down, cross-training is, certainly, one way of having fun.</li></ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The body is flexible. It is supposed to be flexible. You must be able to bend and reach that something you dropped on the floor. You must be able to zip the back of your favorite dress on your own. You must be able to reach that book you need to read at the top shelf. <br> These are simple activities. Nothing grand about them, you merely stretched out a bit. However, if there are difficulties in doing such simple motions, then you have to stretch your limits. You already need a stretching program.</p>



<p>What Is Stretching?<br> Stretching is simply the act of extending to full length the body or simply a part of it. This activity involves straightening or stretching the structure or the limbs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3-weight-loss.jpg" alt="Losing weight the right way" class="wp-image-171" width="328" height="228" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3-weight-loss.jpg 345w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3-weight-loss-300x209.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" /></a></figure>



<p>How Does One Do the Stretching?<br> Stretching is fairly easy. As mentioned in the introduction, it is involved in normal activities. It can be done by any people, regardless of age.</p>



<p>However, the extent of stretching and flexing differs. The muscles tighten as a person ages. The range of joint movements can be minimized. This can very well obstruct an on-the-go lifestyle. That is why as the person grows older, bending or flexing becomes more limited. This is why stretching regularly, as part of a routine is very important.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package.jpg" alt="Weight Loss Program" class="wp-image-206" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package.jpg 250w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Simple stretches can be done every day. It can be incorporated into the lifestyle and daily activities. It does not require much of your time. </p>



<p>Stretching exercises can also be done while training. Actually, stretching is an essential part of any training or sport. It must be done first before anything else. Stretching the body and the limbs is good preparation for more rigorous activity. </p>



<p>Most athletes would do the sit and reach, wherein they position on the floor, extend their legs and reach the tip of their foot with the tip of their hand. Actually, most trainers actually require their athletes to really do the stretching before playing. </p>



<p>There is actually an ideal length of time in stretching. It is best to do it in 10 minutes. This will give the body enough opportunity to move and flex the muscles, thus preparing it for more complicated and strenuous movements. <br> Experts, however, would frown upon going way beyond 10 minutes. Stretching the exercise to 30 minutes or more will already wear out the body. This will not be favorable if one is preparing for a game. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22-weight-loss.jpg" alt="weight loss" class="wp-image-181" width="365" height="204" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22-weight-loss.jpg 429w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22-weight-loss-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></a></figure>



<ol><li>Increase the Range of Movement<br> As one constantly do the stretching exercises, the length of the muscles and the tendons are also increased. This will help in increasing the range of your movement. Thus, the limbs and joints will be able to move, way before an injury can take place. You are definitely physically fit.</li><li>Increased Ability to Perform Skills<br> When you have a wide range of movement, the more you will be able to do more things. For example, you can jump high without feeling any pain when you land back on the floor. This will also help you start a new sport or improve more if you are in one. Stretching in this aspect also allows you to have a more active lifestyle.</li><li>Injury Prevention<br> One can prevent injury to joints, tendons, and muscles with stretching. When the muscles and tendons are well-flexed, they are considered in good working order. This will help in faster recovery and decreased soreness. The muscles of the body will be able to take more exhausting and rigorous movements with less probability of being injured. </li><li>Reduce Muscle Tension<br> If the muscles are given their regular exercises and stretching, it is less likely that they will contract. This will definitely relieve you of any muscle pain or problems. </li><li>Enhance Energy<br> Being able to move more will also give you more energy. Stretching will also help enhance your awareness, like knowing that you have a body that is capable of doing many things. As such, you are going to be more driven to move rather than sulk in the corner. </li><li>Reduces Cholesterol<br> Research also shows that doing prolonged stretching exercises, like yoga, will help reduce the cholesterol in the body. This, of course, must be done with a healthy diet at hand. This could prevent and even reverse the hardening of the arteries, allowing you to avoid coronary diseases. <br> Incorporate stretching into your everyday lifestyle. It has benefits you can not say no to. It also does not require much. It can be your usual activities, bending and flexing every now and then. After all, your fitness is everything so do what it takes to keep the body healthy. </li></ol>

<p>When it comes to living a long and healthy life, there are two necessary ingredients: diet and fitness. While some believe that they are one thing all together, nothing could be further from the truth. It is quite possible to have a perfectly healthy diet with deplorable fitness habits. It is equally possible to be very physically fit with less than savory eating habits. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a clever little line in the Jimmy Buffet song &#8220;Fruitcakes&#8221; when his &#8216;lady&#8217; is lamenting: <br> &#8220;I treat my body like a temple <br>  You treat yours like a tent&#8221;.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t help but think of this line whenever I think about all the people around the world who are going on this garbage in, garbage out diet plans hoping to achieve the <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="weight loss success (opens in a new tab)">weight loss success</a> of those who are endorsing these products. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/28-weight-loss.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-185" width="335" height="251"/></a></figure>



<p>To be completely honest, it is possible to shed pounds through diet alone. It is difficult but possible. It is also possible to be physically fit and have a few extra pounds hanging around. To a large degree, we are what we eat. If we consume a high-fat low substance diet our bodies are going to lack the fuel required to burn the fat. At the same time if we aren&#8217;t providing our bodies with the tools it needs to build muscle it doesn&#8217;t matter how many weights we lift.</p>



<p>When it comes to diet and fitness, the best results are achieved when they work together rather than separately. Use your fitness routine to burn excess calories and use your diet in order to properly provide your body the nutrients and fuel it needs to build muscle. I&#8217;ve heard many times in my life that a pound of muscle<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" weighs less (opens in a new tab)"> weighs less</a> than a pound of fat. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package.png" alt="" class="wp-image-191" width="294" height="294" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package.png 250w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>While this is not true at all, a pound is a pound regardless; a pound of muscle occupies less space on the body than a pound of fat. Pound for pound, I would much rather mine be composed of muscle than fat. Dieting alone does not build muscle and that is something you will do well to remember in your efforts. </p>



<p>You should also realize that as you are building muscle you may be shedding inches while not showing a great deal of progress on the scale. It is very important that you keep this in mind throughout the<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" weight loss process (opens in a new tab)"> weight loss process</a>. Do not measure your progress by the scales alone or you will achieve misleading results. The problem is that far too many people do just this and get frustrated and give up when they are actually making progress. Do not allow yourself to be a victim of the scales. Look in the mirror, try on your tight pants, and measure your waistline. Measure your success by how you feel after climbing a flight of stairs not by how many pounds fell of the scale this week.</p>



<p>By incorporating fitness into your diet routine you are also enabling your body to burn off any extra calories you may have consumed during the day. This means that if you want to have a small &#8216;cheat&#8217; during your day, you can make up for it by burning a few more calories than normal in the evening. This isn&#8217;t something that should happen often but an occasional occurrence isn&#8217;t going to make or break your diet. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20-weight-loss.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-180" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20-weight-loss.jpg 597w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20-weight-loss-300x121.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></a></figure>



<p>You should also look at<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" dieting (opens in a new tab)"> dieting</a> and fitness as a ball and glove type of relationship. While you can play ball without the glove, it seems to work so much better if you have both. Diet and fitness when combined can create fantastic weight loss results for those who take them both seriously. The thing to remember is that neither works as well alone and neither will work unless you are willing to do the work. You must make this a priority in your life in order to achieve the best possible results. </p>

<p>What Does It Take To Lose Body Fat?</p>



<p>To lose body fat, you need to incorporate sheer simplicity, plus ultimate science because understanding how to lose body fat comprises your awareness of BOTH concepts. Now is the time to prepare your heart and mind for non-stop challenge, consistent focus, and utmost care.</p>



<p>You are here seeking some viable remedy, correct? Our time together here is far more worthwhile if I just go ahead and tell you, right now, what it takes to lose body fat. In a nutshell, your biggest key is mental preparedness. Yep. That&#8217;s the biggie!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/28-weight-loss.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-185" width="349" height="261"/></a></figure>



<p>As soon as you discover how to convince your mind to issue &#8220;lose body fat&#8221; commands, you are well on your way to fitness success.</p>



<p></p>



<p>To lose body fat, then, is a quite simple matter. Ye, of course, the difficulty you may face lies in your initial THINKING, then the reality of DOING.</p>



<p>There are a few things you will have to do in order to lose body fat. If and when you are willing and ready to do these things, you are SURE to lose body fat, without question.</p>



<p>LONG-TERM &#8220;LOSE BODY FAT&#8221; SOLUTION</p>



<p>Does It Really Pay To Seek A Short Cut To Lose-Body-Fat Satisfaction?</p>



<p>After you spin yourself virtually all the way around in a lose-body-fat circle by asking questions from sources that either really doesn&#8217;t know the truth, or even worse, only care to tell whatever it takes to separate you from your checkbook, credit card, or wallet &#8212; the simplicity and long-time duality of how to lose body fat remains unchanged. Ease versus complexity… long way around versus short-cut solutions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-206" width="308" height="308" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package.jpg 250w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/losing-fat-package-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" /></a></figure>



<p>Somebody or someone (meaning YOU) has to do the work! You want to lose body fat, that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re here. So, your body needs to engage required, time-proven, professional principles that prove themselves for you over and again. In short, to lose body fat you clearly build independence, self-assuredness, confidence, and other lose-body-fat skills that surprisingly emanate from your mental intellectual potential rather than merely your present physical ability.</p>



<p>HOW TO LOSE BODY FAT &#8211; HERE IS YOUR 3-STEP CURE</p>



<p>Simply do these three things to lose body fat:</p>



<p>ONE: Once and for all, learn how to find out your daily caloric consumption AND your energy expenditure numbers. Both of these numbers are absolutely crucial because they tell you exactly what your body is doing, right down to the very calorie. Once this calculation process becomes second nature to you, full control of the amount of body fat you carry lay right in the palms of your very hands.</p>



<p>In other words, you can shape your &#8220;lose-body-fat&#8221; fortune and alter your lean body appearance almost exactly how you want it to be.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-329" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1.jpg 930w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1-300x97.jpg 300w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1-768x248.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></a></figure>



<p>TWO: Work out, for the most part, using much more drive and intensity than you ever have before in your entire life! I say this to you primarily because of 1) remotely conscious human tendencies that we all have toward relaxation and taking the easy way out of a challenging situation rather than facing and conquering its root cause, plus 2) endorsed exercise science knowledge says that performing at higher thresholds gives you life-extending benefits and burns higher amounts of calories from excess body fat. So, to enormously yet safely lose body fat, begin to train yourself towards high-intensity interval exercise.</p>



<p>You may burn twice as many calories as you did before, plus feel better and look better, too.</p>



<p>THREE: Lastly, know that the entire weight-loss-lose-body-fat scenario revolves around one, vital and never-changing concept: Being overweight, thus, needing to lose body fat, remains a direct result of eating too much food and not getting enough exercise. Now, with this last one, allow me to isolate your biggest probable obstacle. The number one problem is that you hear this very same lose-body-fat news so much and so often that your brain instantly goes into SHUT-DOWN or shut-off mode.

<p>Dieting for Health</p>



<p>There is no greater reason to diet than for your personal health and well being. Those of us who are overweight know better than most the risks and possible consequences that may result because of our weight. Much like smokers, however, the risks do not always seem quite so cut and dry until we reach our very own turning point. Whether your eating habits are born of an addiction to certain foods, an emotional need, or years of learned behavior and conditioning things will not change until you completely adjust your eating habits and your lifestyle choices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/7-weight-loss.jpg" alt="losing fat the right way" class="wp-image-174" width="406" height="222" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/7-weight-loss.jpg 438w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/7-weight-loss-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></a></figure>



<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dieting (opens in a new tab)">Dieting</a> for many has become a lifestyle in and of itself with people rapidly flip-flopping or yo-yoing from one diet to another with little success and growing despair over a sheer lack of results. The truth is that until you decide to forgive yourself for your failures and get right back on the wagon, so to speak, after falling off no diet is going to be successful. </p>



<p>A simple diet isn&#8217;t going to magically make the pounds disappear and constantly depriving yourself of those things you enjoy most may have a more detrimental effect than a positive effect.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package.png" alt="weight loss program" class="wp-image-191" width="273" height="273" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package.png 250w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>The number one thing most people need to learn is that dieting isn&#8217;t always a good thing. What most people who are overweight need more than anything else is to incorporate positive lifestyle changes into their daily routines. People scoff at the notion of taking the stairs or parking farther away and yet those are perfectly plausible methods of working a little more physical activity into your day. If those do not work for you how about learning to dance? Seriously, there are beginner dance classes in most communities that will welcome and invite dances of all ages, sizes, and fitness levels if you are willing to make the effort. What a great way to get fit, learn something new, and have fun without filling deprived. </p>



<p>Another great thing about an activity such as a dance class (consider ballroom dancing with your significant other) is that you are not eating or tempted to eat during the time that you are dancing in most cases. Another great thing is that you are burning those calories you didn&#8217;t eat. If dancing isn&#8217;t your thing, try joining a walking club or finding another hobby. Anything that gets you on your feet and away from the temptation of your refrigerator is a good thing when it comes to dieting and<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" weight loss (opens in a new tab)"> weight loss</a>. You cannot lose a significant amount of weight by dieting alone. You must incorporate physical fitness into your daily routine in order to achieve those immediate and visually stunning results that many dieters are hoping to achieve.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fat-woman-on-scale-.jpg" alt="weight loss" class="wp-image-157" width="375" height="281" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fat-woman-on-scale-.jpg 800w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fat-woman-on-scale--300x225.jpg 300w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fat-woman-on-scale--768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></a><figcaption>overweight women sitting on scales isolated on white</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another pitfall when it comes to dieting is that people give up far too quickly. Just as the results are beginning and progressing people get tired of the process or frustrated that they aren&#8217;t accomplishing enough dramatic <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="weight loss  (opens in a new tab)">weight loss </a>as quickly as they had hoped and given up all together marking off yet another failure when they could have achieved greater success than ever before if they had stuck with their original diet plan a little longer.</p>



<p>One more thing you should remember when it comes to dieting is that the scale can be your best friend or your worst enemy when<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" dieting (opens in a new tab)"> dieting</a>. If you are weighing yourself every day in hopes of watching the scale tick off yet another pound you are dooming yourself to failure. You will never achieve the results you are hoping for you if you are going into depressive bouts of Rocky Road or Chunky Monkey every night because you didn&#8217;t lose 10 pounds overnight. </p>



<p>When it comes to dieting there are very few diets that work. There are, however, many lifestyle changes that when practiced consistently and aggressively will work. The thing to remember is that you are the one who must work because it is quite unlikely that any diet will. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When it comes to the world of dieting you will find that there are many diets, weight loss, and fitness plans on the market. It takes years for some to become a contender and others remain a best-kept secret of sorts.</p>



<p>One such &#8216;best kept&#8217; secret would be the 3 Hour Diet that was designed by Jorge Cruise. I am sure that there is much reading along and chuckling under your breath that there is no way one can<a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" lose weigh (opens in a new tab)"> lose weigh</a>t by eating every three hours however the science behind the theory is fairly common and Jorge Cruise is a mainstay in the fitness industry. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-weight-loss.jpg" alt="losing weight" class="wp-image-172" width="416" height="224" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-weight-loss.jpg 446w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-weight-loss-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></a></figure>



<p>The long and short of this diet operates with the knowledge that if you do not feed your body accurately and regularly your body will go into what is called &#8216;starvation mode&#8217;.</p>



<p>In this mode, your body holds onto the fat rather than burning it up and consuming it for use. This means that your body is burning muscle rather than fat to take the energy it needs in order to function. </p>



<p>With the 3 Hour Diet, you will not feel hungry all the time, in fact, there are many who claim they are constantly setting alarms and reminding themselves to eat. You will also learn the proper foods to eat in order to achieve the best possible results.</p>



<p>The key is in learning which foods are right for you when <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dieting (opens in a new tab)">dieting</a> with this plan. You can purchase the book The 3-Hour Diet by Jorge Cruise and you can sign up online for more information about the weight plan itself and how to incorporate it into your busy routine. </p>



<p>I do recommend purchasing the book if you are seriously considering this as your method of dieting as there are many wonderful hints, tips, and tricks that are mentioned in the book to help you keep things going no matter how busy and hectic your lifestyle may be. One thing you need to keep in mind is that dieting with a program such as this is no small commitment.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weight-loss-package.png" alt="weight loss program" class="wp-image-91"/></a></figure></div>



<p>You need to stick to the timetable as much as possible in order to achieve the results this plan is famous for. If you aren&#8217;t willing to eat every three hours then this plan really may not be the plan for you.</p>



<p>Otherwise, if this is something you would be interested in, I highly recommend it. There are special considerations based on the amount you weight currently and the amount of weight you are hoping to lose. It is best if you are honest throughout the process in order to achieve the best possible and most immediate results.</p>



<p>The claim is that you can lose as many as 10 pounds in the first two weeks and there are those that have claimed to do just that over and over again. This is a diet that even many celebrities endorse for quick and immediate results. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18-weight-loss.jpg" alt="Healthy Living Program" class="wp-image-179" width="324" height="216" srcset="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18-weight-loss.jpg 360w, https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18-weight-loss-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></a></figure>



<p>The good and the bad about 3-hour dieting is that it is effective but takes a very real commitment on the part of the one that is <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dieting (opens in a new tab)">dieting</a>. This diet is one that is taking the world by storm. If you haven&#8217;t heard of it before now, please take the time to check it out and see if this is something you could incorporate into your life.</p>



<p>The results that have been reported as a result of this diet as nothing short of phenomenal. If there were one diet I would recommend above others for those who hate feeling hungry, it would be this diet.</p>

<h4>1- Don’t Skip Breakfast</h4>



<p>The morning meal jump-starts your metabolism and helps to prevent bingeing later in the day.  A cup of coffee does not count – the caffeine and added sugar may give you a bit of energy and suppress your appetite for a little while it is sure to backfire into severe hunger and you will be more likely to overeat later.  Breakfast should include complex carbohydrates like whole grain (granola or oatmeal), along with some protein and fat (low-fat yogurt or milk), which will keep your energy levels even and hunger in check.</p>



<h4>2- Eat more often</h4>



<p>Get into the habit of eating every three to four hours or at least four times a day.  Eating frequently stabilizes blood sugar, when blood sugar drops too low you want to eat…a lot.  By keeping your blood sugar stable you can control your appetite and keep your metabolic rate high.  When you go many hours without eating your body will compensate by slowing down to conserve energy…this effect hurts your <a href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="weight loss (opens in a new tab)">weight loss</a> efforts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://weightloss.peerooz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fruites-11.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-186" width="370" height="235"/></figure>



<h4>3- Eat protein at every meal</h4>



<p>Protein will help to reduce your appetite, it takes more energy and time to digest, in effect you feel full longer than eating carbohydrates alone.  Research shows that eating more protein can help you lose weight without cutting calories.  Try these protein possibilities: turkey on whole wheat; hummus and pita; vegetarian chili; fruit and nuts; or protein snack bars that contain 12 or more grams of protein.</p>



<h4>4- Hold off on snacking</h4>



<p>Many of us grab a snack for quick energy when we are feeling tired.  But do not confuse true hunger with fatigue.  If you are feeling tired go for a 15-20 minute brisk walk.  This will raise your heart rate and give you a boost of energy.  Follow it up with a large glass of cool water.  If you are truly hungry have a protein and complex carbohydrate-rich snack like; whole wheat crackers and peanut butter or cheese. </p>

<h4>5- Consume enough for your body’s needs</h4>



<p>Eating too little slows your body’s metabolism the same way eating to infrequently does.  If you want to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="lose weight (opens in a new tab)" href="http://bit.ly/2BamQhj" target="_blank">lose weight</a>, do not slash your calories too drastically.  Instead, cut out some of the extras in your diet – things like soda, juice, packaged goods, or candy.  Processed foods tend to be high in fat and calories and low in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</p>
